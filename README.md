## Installation

To make it easier for TeX to resolve `\usepackage{cxltx-styles-*}` commands, put a symlink to your
CXLTX Styles directory into a directory that is on LaTeX's search path. On OSX with TeX Live, that can
be achieved by doing

    cd ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
    ln -s route/to/cxltx-styles cxltx-styles

In a [more general fashion](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/1138/28067), you may want to

    kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME

then take that route (e.g. `/Users/$USER/Library/texmf`) and append `/tex/latex` (which gets you
`/Users/$USER/Library/texmf/tex/latex`) to obtain a suitable location. It may be necessary to first create
that location using `mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex`. Confusing it certainly is.

### CXLTX Style: Position Absolute

CXLTX Position Absolute (PA) essentially loads [textpos][1], configures it, and adds some useful commands;
these steps are intended to make it easier to specifically put *single* lines of text onto the page, using
absolute coordinates that take the left end, the center point, or the right end of the baseline of the text
and the edge of paper as reference points.

XXXXXX loads `textpos` as

    \usepackage[absolute,overlay]{textpos}

so all material will be absolutely positioned (rather than relative to the current point of insertion), and
put on top of ecerything (?) else on the page. The latter option has been chosen to ensure `pagegrid`s will
not cover material typeset with Position Absolute.

PA uses the starred form, `\begin{textblock*}... \end{textblock*}`, which means that all dimensions must be
given as lengths rather than as pure numbers. I feel this is an advantage, as (1) pure numbers are only
meaningful as 'abstract lengths' as used in geometry, but not as concrete lengths in the physical world; and
(2) only by using length units in the arguments can simple arithmetic like adding lengths be done (`textpos`
uses `calc`).



The 'badge' of this style is `Pa`; it defines the following items:

<!-- ................................................................................................... -->
#### PaGauge

Use `\PaGauge{...}` like

    \PaGauge{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.!ยง\$}

in a suitable place of your document with a suitable sample of characters to have PA determine the
dimensions `\PaStrutHeight`, `\PaStrutDepth`, and the ratio

    \PaHeightDepthRatio = \PaStrutHeight / ( \PaStrutHeight + \PaStrutDepth )

which it will use to determine where the baseline of the specific font lies. Needless to say that you should
make sure that both your character sample
